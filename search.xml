<p>This is mine :D</p>
<p>Sooooo… hello, world! This is the n-th declination of my website. I previously<br>wrote my website’s themes, using whatever implementation of “who knows” of a CMS.<br>I’ve now moved to Hexo, a minimalistic, static-generator blog / website application<br>written for node. So far, so great!</p>
<p>This blog will focus on the things I do in my profession and in my side-works (more to follow).</p>
<p>So… Keep calm and good retro style navigation!</p>
