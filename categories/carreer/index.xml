      <description>First and foremost I consider myself a software architect and engineer. My professional carreer let me focus, from a programming point of view, on web technologies, mostly the common PHP-JS stack (including obviously HTML and CSS). At least here in Italy most of the startups live on PHP and NodeJS, while other structured companies prefere Java and .NET technologies, which I all tried in my professional experience. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a couple of lines on why I&amp;rsquo;d really like to go straight with Golang, or better why I&amp;rsquo;m seriosuly considering to switch to a new programming language for my personal projects and possibly affecting my job applications.</description>
